# taskbasket
Use this repo for tasks that can be picked up and completed by anyone regardless of project affiliation. They can be a part of a bigger project or are items that stand on their own. Ideally, anything that has a tangible input and output. This can include:

- Data scraping (images for OCR, PDF tables for Tabula, etc.)
- Document formatting 
- Requests for research
- Anything that has a static output.

To include an item in taskbasket:

1. Create a new directory inside `Input` with a meaningful name
2. Provide a README describing the task and the expected output of the task.
3. Include any relevant documents/ links/ etc.
3. Commit
4. Announce the task on [Open Savannah](http://forum.opensavannah.org/t/task-basket-announcements/113)
